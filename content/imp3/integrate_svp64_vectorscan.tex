\section{Integrating SVP64 into Vectorscan}

Vectorscan has a large codebase, and it heavily depends on SIMD intrinsics from
ARM, Intel, PowerISA, etc., so VectorCamp decided on implementing some common
SIMD functions using SVP64. These would then be integrated into a separate
branch of Vectorscan.

VectorCamp began with including the \texttt{pypowersim} (wrapper for the
Libre-SOC simulator) into the \texttt{cmake} build system. This requires
setting up Vectorscan within the same chroot environment used to run the SVP64
simulator, which can be difficult given Vectorscan's dependencies on later
versions of C++ (which are not so easily available with the version of Debian
used for the chroot).

Commits covering the changes done to Vectorscan to support SVP64 are available
\href{https://github.com/ngisearchsvp64/vectorscan/commits/feature/svp64-port/}{here}.

\subsection{Setup script}
The shell script for getting the Vectorscan SVP64 test running can be found
