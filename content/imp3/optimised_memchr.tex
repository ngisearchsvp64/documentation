\section{Optimised \texttt{memchr} Function}

\subsection{The code}

The function was implemented in the python 

\begin{verbatim}
"cmpi 0,1,5,0", # Check if n==0
"bc 12, 2, 0x44", # Jump to no match

"mtspr 9, 5",                   # move r5 to CTR
"add 7,3,5",         # start address+len
# start + len + 2 (if this is final pointer val, no match)
"addi 7,7,2",
# VL (and r1) = MIN(CTR,MAXVL)
"setvl 1,0,4,0,1,1",
# load VL bytes (update r3 addr, current pointer)
"sv.lbzu/pi *16, 1(3)",
# cmp against zero, truncate VL
"sv.cmp/ff=eq/vli *0,1,*16,4",
# test CTR, stop if any cmp failed
"sv.bc/all 0, *2, -0x10",

# Check for no match, add offset to get actual found address
# If pointer just outside of array, no match.
"cmp 0,1,3,7",
"bc 12, 2, 0x14",

# Adjust pointer in Reg 3 because search ends at multiples of
# VL value
"setvl 6,0,1,0,0,0", # Get current value of VL
"addi 6,6,%d" % ((-1*maxvl)-1), # calculate offset for found char
# Reg 3 will now be found address, or one byte outside of array
"add 3,3,6",
"b 0x8",

# No match, set to 1 (offset is removed later)
"addi 3,0,0",
# this could be replaced by return call
"nop",
\end{verbatim}
